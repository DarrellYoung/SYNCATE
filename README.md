### SYNCATE: Synchronizing Human-Machine Collaboration for Enhanced Team Efficiency

**Welcome to SYNCATE, an open-source protocol designed to revolutionize the way human and machine agents collaborate.**

At the heart of cutting-edge research and applications, SYNCATE offers a dynamic calibration framework that facilitates seamless integration, rapid adaptation, and optimized performance in mixed human-machine teams. By leveraging real-time assessment and adjustment mechanisms, SYNCATE ensures that any group of agents—whether purely human, purely machine, or any combination thereof—can efficiently form, storm, norm, and perform with minimal setup time and maximum efficiency.

**Why SYNCATE?**

- **Rapid Team Formation:** Leverage advanced algorithms to quickly assess and integrate new team members, reducing the time from team assembly to high performance.
- **Dynamic Calibration:** Continuously adjust team roles, communication styles, and task allocations in real-time for optimal collaboration and outcomes.
- **Enhanced Performance:** Achieve superior results through improved understanding, predictability, and synchronization of team members' actions and objectives.
- **Cross-Disciplinary Appeal:** Designed for researchers and practitioners across fields such as robotics, AI, organizational behavior, psychology, and beyond.

High-Level Design
Core Simulator: The main engine that runs simulation cycles, manages agent states, and coordinates interactions.
Agent Module: Defines basic agent behaviors and properties. This module can be extended to create more complex agents.
Plugin Framework: Allows for the dynamic addition of new behaviors or rules without altering the core simulator code.

Running main.py should now show the agents acting according to both the base behavior defined in agent.py and any behaviors added by plugins. This basic setup demonstrates the plug-in architecture. You can extend it by creating more sophisticated agents, environments, and plugins that demonstrate various SYNCATE principles.
Environment Module: Represents the simulation environment where agents interact.
